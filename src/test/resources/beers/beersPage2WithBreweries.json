Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!","website":"http:\/\/www.dogfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_wK061d-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_wK061d-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g0jHqt\/upload_wK061d-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2012-04-23 23:50:56","locations":[{"id":"Mq24sa","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Cannery Village Center","locality":"Milton","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19968","phone":"302-684-1000","website":"http:\/\/www.dogfish.com\/","latitude":38.770622,"longitude":-75.310893,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2012-03-21 20:05:25","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"urlTitle":"united-states","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"57kBD4","name":"Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats","streetAddress":"320 Rehoboth Avenue","locality":"Rehoboth Beach","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19971","phone":"302-226-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.dogfish.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open 7 Days, Year Round!

A Lowes warehouse opened up just a half-mile from their store, which their dad bought some 35 years ago.\r\n\r\nLike a lot of stores that have faced a similar dilemma, the Lutz owners decided they couldn\u2019t compete against big box stores. Instead of closing for good, they transformed their space into a seven-barrel microbrewery and brew-on-premise shop.\r\n\r\nIt may sound like an odd transition, but the Kuhnhenn Brothers have been in the beer business for some time. As well as being active homebrewers, they have sold homebrewing supplies out of the back of their hardware store for many years.\r\n\r\nBret Kuhnhenn says there is a long tradition of selling brewing supplies out of hardware stores. The Brothers began offering supplies out of the frustration of not being able to buy products locally.\r\n\r\nThe transition is a special one for Bret and Eric because of their love for the art of brewing. They make one of the best German-style Hefeweizens in the Detroit Metro Area as well as many other Award Winning lagers and ales. The brothers bottle their beers in 12 and 22 oz. bottles as well as offering kegs.
