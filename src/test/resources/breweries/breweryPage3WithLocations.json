Heritage is important to us and all our beers are made with a definitive nod to the brewers and breweries of former times. If we can develop great beer and give people a history lesson at the same time we would be two very happy brewers!\r\n\r\nWe regularly produce a range of four core beers (North, South, West and East) and North Pole is brewed for the festive season.

We claim the unofficial record for production on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week. The addition of a new, 100-barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve the entire Pacific Northwest and later the Desert Southwest.  Brewing beer in Alaska isn't easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn't dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all seems worthwhile if you can go home to a dinner of king crab or fresh halibut.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_ZO4ekQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_ZO4ekQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_ZO4ekQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-07-22 12:25:35","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Drive","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Business hours:\r\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday\r\n\r\nGift shop and tour hours:\r\nWinter Hours: October - April: 11 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Tuesday - Saturday\r\nSummer Hours: May - September: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week","latitude":58.3568493,"longitude":-134.4892297,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-03-21 20:05:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"urlTitle":"united-states","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"NxRmqR","name":"Albquell Br\u00e4uhaus","website":"http:\/\/www.albquell-brauhaus.de\/","established":"1851","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:18","updateDate":"2012-08-15 13:29:35","locations":[{"id":"Asc8GM","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Lindenplatz 6","region":"Trochtelfingen","postalCode":"D-72818","latitude":48.308365,"longitude":9.245219,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 13:30:05","updateDate":"2012-08-15 13:30:05","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"urlTitle":"germany","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"XIPWtQ","name":"Alcatraz Brewing Co","description":"San Francisco's exciting sights and extraordinary cuisine have been captured for your enjoyment at Alcatraz Brewing Company!\r\n\r\nTake a virtual vacation to San Francisco every time you visit one of our locations across the U.S. See scale replicas of the Golden Gate Bridge and a Chinese pagoda while sampling foods from famous Bay Area neighborhoods.

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pdLPeS\/upload_0Ut2Nj-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2012-10-22 17:17:24","locations":[{"id":"hP5LHZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"50 Industrial Way","locality":"Portland","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04103","phone":"800-330-5385","website":"http:\/\/www.allagash.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri: 9:30 am - 5:30 pm","latitude":43.702697,"longitude":-70.317975,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2012-03-21 20:05:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"urlTitle":"united-states","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"Rx4Dnt","name":"Allentown Brew Works","description":"The Allentown Brew Works is housed inside the historic Harold's Furniture Building at 812 W Hamilton Street.
