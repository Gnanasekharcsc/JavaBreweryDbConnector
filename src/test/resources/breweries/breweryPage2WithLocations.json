They decided that brewing a good beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most.\r\n\r\nWhen 961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are).

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-12-16 14:42:39","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.731819,"longitude":10.190885,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:08:01","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"urlTitle":"norway","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"BVG7Ls","name":"Abandon Brewing Company","description":"Overlooking beautiful Keuka Lake, we will be brewing many different styles of craft beer for the Penn Yan and surrounding Finger Lakes areas.","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_x75HYl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_x75HYl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_x75HYl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:36:49","updateDate":"2012-10-24 11:38:32","locations":[{"id":"WLxlVR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2994 Merritt Hill Road","locality":"Penn Yan","region":"New York","postalCode":"14527","phone":"(585) 356-1552","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.630677,"longitude":-77.104023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:37:40","updateDate":"2012-10-24 11:37:40","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"urlTitle":"united-states","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"dleKhW","name":"Abashiri Beer","website":"http:\/\/www.takahasi.co.jp","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 16:39:09","updateDate":"2012-12-21 16:39:17"},{"id":"5ac2lB","name":"Abbaye de Leffe","website":"http:\/\/www.abbaye-de-leffe.be\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_rHwnfZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_rHwnfZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_rHwnfZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-12-16 14:49:10","locations":[{"id":"IuEeGC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Dinant","locality":"Dinant","region":"Namur","phone":"+32 (0)82 22 23 77","website":"http:\/\/www.abbaye-de-leffe.be\/","latitude":50.260479,"longitude":4.91193,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:08:01","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"urlTitle":"belgium","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"huKquc","name":"Abbaye de Maredsous","description":"Beer Maredsous is a beer Belgian of high fermentation brewed by Moortgat.

In its first year, the brewery produced 1,500 barrels of beer. We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100 seat brew pub) and were forced to move up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand. Today, we brew over 62,000 barrels of beer and 3,000 barrels of root beer, and we're still growing! But don't let our growth fool you. Our lagers and ales are still brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews. Abita uses only the finest ingredients  British and American barley, German yeast, European and Washington State hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs. In Abita, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way. Abita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes. We're proud of our brewery and the beers we make.
