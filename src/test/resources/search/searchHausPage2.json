It's called an American Hefeweizen because unlike it's German cousins it has simply a clean and refreshing taste with hints of strawberry & citrus (Bavarian Hefeweizen's are known for a very strong banana and\/or clove taste while Berliner Hefe's are sour). This is a great beer for enjoying the warm weather and a very good beer to drink while eating summer foods like BBQ, Grilled Swordfish, Burgers or a Blackened NYS Strip Steak fresh off the grill. There will be regular one time brews of Summer Haze brewed with honey, lemons, strawberries, and raspberries available at our future home during the spring and summer.","abv":"5","ibu":"15","glasswareId":9,"availableId":4,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-09 13:31:57","updateDate":"2012-06-09 18:25:01","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":"4","name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

The malt is a de-husked German black malt, it provides the color, and the roast flavor without the risk of extra acidity. It creates this intense roasted coffee and chocolate aroma.

Barley malt and wheat help create a smooth body and attribute a pleasant golden hue while the addition of malted rye and oats brings out a solid earthy flavor. Czech Saaz Hops help create a citrus nose.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this beer truly special is the Saison Ale yeast strain used to ferment this beer. The subtle hints of tangerine, peach and licorice are the hallmarks of this particular yeast.\r\n\r\nBooyah is a farmhouse ale, which means it\u2019s a kitchen sink type of recipe, so there are no rules when it comes to grain bill, hops or yeast. When it comes to grain, just name it, barley, oats, wheat, rye and corn. The rye malt and oats produce a really earthy smell in the mash. For this ale we use a specific saison ale strain. This yeast has been cultured to produce a lot of fruity and spicy esters, such as apricot, clove, banana and anise. Keeping the a fermentation temperature at 68 degrees controls the ester of the yeast strain. This yeast strain also likes to take its\u2019 time, a long and slow fermentation settles out the finished beer. This is a good sippin\u2019 beer for me. I enjoy a glass when all the work of the day is done. The complexity of this beer re-energizes me.\r\n\r\nThis is a great seasonal beer that we released in the spring the last two years.
