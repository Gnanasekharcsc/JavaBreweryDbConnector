Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The \u201cAdmiral\u201d Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.\r\n\r\nWe first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as \u201cShake Down Nut Brown\u201d. You can guess what went wrong from there\u2026 But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.","abv":"7","ibu":"23","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.071","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:35:27","updateDate":"2012-09-09 13:50:59","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":"4","name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"type":"beer"},{"id":"Hwb3pk","name":"Barleywine","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:45","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:35","type":"beer"},{"id":"NXD6av","name":"Porter","abv":"5.9","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:35","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

The \u201cintake\u201d was marked by a big structure that was prominent off the Bradford Beach shoreline. Because of the privacy (in plain view!)the Rock was a popular lookout point for ambitious suitors.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 16:06:46"},"type":"beer"},{"id":"oBcqwo","name":"Pull Chain","description":"The Pull Chain Pale Ale is a fusion of English and American pale ale styles, with bitterness derived for an unusual and innovative hop schedule in the recipe.

They\u2019re softened by malty undertones.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite everyday beers. First developed in the fall of 1997, we designed Pull Chain to be a well balanced and refreshing. We use a blend of American and English Hops to create a play between hop bitterness and malt flavor. This allows Pull Chain to be paired with with most foods. The simplicity of the mash and the hop additions make the brewing process very easy going, that is, until we get to the dry hopping process. Timing the dry hopping can be tricky. It has to be timed just right to get the maximum aroma from the hops. We extend the post fermentation aging to extract more aroma and flavor from the dry hopping.","abv":"5","ibu":"41","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oBcqwo\/upload_tHClUD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.053","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:26:22","updateDate":"2013-02-06 12:58:55","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":"1","name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
